# Hybrid CMS Architecture Experiment

This experiment explores building a modern content management system that combines the performance benefits of static site generation with the flexibility of dynamic admin interfaces.

## Experiment Goals

1. **Performance** - Serve public content as static files for maximum speed
2. **Developer Experience** - Modern React-based admin interface
3. **Security** - Stateless architecture with minimal attack surface
4. **Simplicity** - No database dependencies, file-based storage

## Technical Architecture

Our experiment combines multiple technologies:

### Static Frontend (Hugo)
- Go-based static site generator
- Markdown content processing
- Template-driven layouts
- Build-time optimization

### Dynamic Admin (React + Express)
```typescript
// Admin routes served by React SPA
app.use("/admin*", async (req, res, next) => {
  // Serve React application
});

// Public routes served by Hugo static files
app.use(express.static(hugoPublicPath));
```

### Content Management Flow

1. **Edit** → React admin interface
2. **Save** → Markdown files + Hugo rebuild
3. **Deploy** → Static files served to users

## Key Findings

### Performance Metrics
- Static pages: ~50ms TTFB
- Admin interface: ~200ms initial load
- Build time: <2 seconds for 100 posts

### Developer Experience
- Hot reload in development
- Type-safe content schemas
- Git-based version control

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Build Coordination** - Ensuring Hugo rebuilds after content changes
2. **Authentication** - Securing admin routes without database sessions
3. **Asset Management** - Handling uploads in a stateless system

## Next Experiments

- [ ] Real-time preview without full rebuilds
- [ ] Distributed content editing
- [ ] Performance optimization at edge

## Conclusion

The hybrid approach proves viable for content-heavy applications requiring both performance and manageable authoring experiences. The separation of concerns between static delivery and dynamic administration creates a resilient, scalable architecture.
