## Why Choose Hugo?

2. **Flexibility** - Supports multiple content formats and themes
3. **No Dependencies** - Single binary with no external dependencies

## Key Features

## Getting Started

To create a new Hugo site:

```bash
hugo new site my-blog
cd my-blog
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

## Content Organization

Hugo organizes content in a structured way:

- `content/` - Your markdown files
- `layouts/` - HTML templates
- `static/` - Static assets

This makes it easy to maintain and scale your website as it grows.
